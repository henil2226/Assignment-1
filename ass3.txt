Module 5 :- HTML5

1. What are the new tags added in HTML5?
In HTML5, some new tags have names like header, nav, section, article, aside, footer, 
video, audio, canvas,svg, and more..

2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
If we want to add audio to our webpage, we can use the <audio> tag. We just need to 
specify the audio file we want to use with the src attribute. We can also add controls,
like play and pause buttons, to allow the user to control the audio. Similarly, if we want
to add a video, we can use the <video> tag. We just need to specify the video file using the 
src attribute and the browser will show the video with built-in controls.

3. Semantic element in HTML5?
Semantic elements in HTML5 are special tags that give meaning to our content. Some examples of these tags
are header, nav, section, article, aside ,footer, mark.

4. Canvas and SVG tags 
In HTML5, we have two tags for graphics: canvas and svg. The canvas tag allows us to create dynamic 
and interactive graphics using JavaScript.  the svg tag is used for creating scalable vector graphics. 
It's good for making things like icons or charts that can be resized without losing quality.



Module 6 :-JAVASCRIPT BASIC & DOM



Q: What is JavaScript?
A: JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to make our webpages interactive. 
It runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser. JavaScript 
can be used to add dynamic content, handle user interactions, validate forms, create 
animations, and much more.

Q: What is the use of isNaN function?
A: The isNaN function is used to check if a value is "Not-a-Number" (NaN). It takes a 
value as input and returns true if the value is NaN, and false if it is a valid number
 or can be converted to a number. It is commonly used to validate user input, especially
 when dealing with numeric values.

Q: What is negative Infinity?
A: Negative Infinity is a special value in JavaScript that represents a number that is 
infinitely small or negative infinity. It is typically the result of a mathematical operation
 that exceeds the lower limit of representable numbers. For example, dividing a negative number 
by zero results in negative Infinity.

Q: Which company developed JavaScript?
A: JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, a software company that was 
a major player in the early web industry. The initial version of JavaScript, known as LiveScript, was
 created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995.

Q: What are undeclared and undefined variables?
A: Undeclared variables refer to variables that have been used in code without being explicitly
 declared using the var, let, or const keywords. They are treated as global variables by default, 
which can cause unintended side effects. Undefined variables, on the other hand, are variables that 
have been declared but have not been assigned a value. They exist in the program's memory but do not 
have a specific value assigned to them. Accessing an undefined variable will result in the value undefined.

Q: Write the code for adding new elements dynamically.
A: Here's an example code snippet to dynamically add a new element to the HTML using JavaScript:


// Create a new element
var newElement = document.createElement("p");

// Add content to the new element
newElement.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";

// Append the new element to an existing element in the HTML
var parentElement = document.getElementById("container");
parentElement.appendChild(newElement);

Q: What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
A: ViewState and SessionState are both mechanisms used in web applications to store data.
ViewState is used to store the state of controls on a web page between postbacks. It is stored 
as a hidden field in the HTML and is sent back and forth between the server and the client. 
ViewState is specific to a single page and is not shared across multiple pages.
SessionState, on the other hand, is used to store data that needs to be maintained across 
multiple requests and pages for a specific user. 

Q: What is the === operator?
A: The === operator in JavaScript is called the strict equality operator. It is used to compare
 two values for equality without performing type coercion. It checks if the values are of the same
 type and have the same value. If the types are different or the values are not the same, it returns
 false. This is different from the loose equality operator (==), which allows type coercion during comparison.

Q: How can the style/class of an element be changed?
A: To change the style of an element using JavaScript, you can manipulate its style property.
 For example, to change the background color of an element with the id "myElement" to
